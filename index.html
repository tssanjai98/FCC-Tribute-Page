            >Kobe Bean Bryant (August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020)</span
          >
          was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he
          spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the
          National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the
          greatest basketball players of all time, Bryant won five NBA
          championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member of the
          All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA
          Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also
          led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league all-time
          regular season and postseason scoring. He was posthumously voted into
          the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the
          NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

            <span class="bold">1996 (Drafted and Traded) : </span>With the 13th
            pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected Kobe
            Bryant, the teenage phenom from Lower Merion High School in
            Philadelphia. They traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vlade
            Divac.

            <span class="bold">1997 (Slam Dunk Contest Champion) : </span>Bryant
            was 18 by the time All-Star Weekend rolled around. He didn’t make
            the team, but he did participate in the Rookie Challenge, and he won
            the Slam Dunk Contest.

            <span class="bold">1999 - 2002 (Three Peat) : </span>Phil Jackson
            had already won six league titles with the Chicago Bulls. He’d twice
            won three in a row. Bryant and Shaq helped him accomplish it a third
            time. The Lakers knocked off the Indiana Pacers in 2000,
            Philadelphia 76ers in 2001 and the New Jersey Nets in 2002 for the
            NBA crown.

            <span class="bold">2004 (Fallout with Shaq) : </span>Bryant and
            O’Neal had butted heads since they first teamed up in 1996. Shaq
            took issue with the style of basketball Bryant played, labeling him
            “selfish” and a “show off.” Bryant didn’t like the way O’Neal
            conditioned himself for the season and disproved of his antics when
            he wanted a higher salary. O’Neal demanded a trade and was sent to
            the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Brian Grant. The
            very next day, Bryant re-signed with the Lakers for seven years and
            $136 million.

            >the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol in February 2008, Bryant’s fortunes
            changed for the better. The Lakers went on to finish 57-25 and
            advanced all the way to the NBA Finals. In the end, the Boston
            Celtics won the series, 3-2. But it was the last time anyone would
            best Bryant in the finals. The next year, the Lakers knocked off the
            Orlando Magic for their 15th title, Bryant’s fourth. And in 2010,
            the Lakers outlasted the Celtics to win Game 7, 83-79. It was
            Bryant’s fifth and final championship ring.

            Bryant published a poem in The Players Tribune, titled “Dear
            Basketball.” In it, he announced that he would be retiring at the
            end of the season. On April 13, 2016, Bryant played in his final NBA
            game.
